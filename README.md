# PortsScan
App developed to practice scanning ports of a computer to discover which of them (between the selected) are opened.
This app asks for an IP address to scan the open ports, the number of the first port to be scanned, and the last one. After this, it will return which port is being scanned. Finally, it requests a path to save the txt file with the opened ports, and checks if it exists. If it doesn't exist, it will create the folder and save the file in the chosen folder.
